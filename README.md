# Cryptocurrency Trading Strategy Backtesting

A simple script for cryptocurrency trading. It has not been put into practice but based on the defined TA and buy/sell signals generated by the TA, it is profitable.

It includes components for fetching historical data, storing it in a PostgreSQL database, adding technical indicators, generating trading signals, and backtesting a trading strategy for various cryptocurrency pairs.

## Prerequisites

- Required Python libraries (ccxt, psycopg2, pandas, sqlalchemy, numpy, ta)

You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

```
pip install ccxt pandas sqlalchemy numpy ta
```

It currently fetches info for BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT, XRP/USDT, and ADA/USDT. I used these as they had the most volume on binanceUS.
